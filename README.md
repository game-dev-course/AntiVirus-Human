# Headline: The Anti-Virus Man

It is a single player game designed to increase hygiene awareness. The player is given various tasks such as cooking or cleaning, during which he can accumulate bacteria. At the end of each mission, if the player has accumulated more than 10 bacteria, he may get sick. The goal of the game is to accumulate as few bacteria as possible and stay healthy.

## How To Play
The player can be moved horizontally with the left and right arrows.
In addition, any item (plates or gloves, etc.) can be collected with the E key on the keyboard.

Now, the game has one step of taking plates from the stack to wash, with gloves along the way that give the player less viruses.
